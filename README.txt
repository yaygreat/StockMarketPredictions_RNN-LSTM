ML Project: Examination of stock predictions using RNN & LSTM

The files necessary to run this project are:
	1. RNN_LSTM.py

(The dataset NASDAQCOM.xl is accessed from a web server as requested from the project description)

Make sure to have Python version up to 3.7.x. (Python 3.8 has several issues with the packages)

Libraries used for this project are:
	pandas
	numpy
	sklearn
	matplotlib
Make sure to have these installed using the 'pip install' command.

To run the program, go to your directory containing the files and run the command:
	python RNN_LSTM.PY

The two parameters that we adjust for our RNN are sequence length (seq_len) and learning rate (lr).
Adjust these two parameters in lines 12 and 13 to observe different results of the RNN model.
